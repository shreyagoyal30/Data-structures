â€‹intuitive .But would like to explain this further in my perspective. first you precompute minimum number you've seen so far for each element and then try to scan the input from ending and see element at current index is greater than minimum element encountered so far till the current index, now we established s1 and s2 we need to find something in b/w as we keep adding every element encountered onto stack from the last, and discard every element less than s1 ,so now we have elements elements greater than s1 for sure, in the result set we look in the stack with in the elements we visited so far if this has any less than s2 , which perfectly establishes s3. in the end we can say we encountered s3.
